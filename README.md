This paper proposed two Novel Convolutions,i.e., Directional Convolution and Large Field Convolution. Directional Convolution contains 45째, -45째, 90째 and 0째 convolution kernels and it can extract features on these directions. Large Field Convolution uses a strategy of sharing weight and it can enlarge the receptive field and reduce parameters.
